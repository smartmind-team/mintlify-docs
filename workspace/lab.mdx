The Lab provides a multi-purpose environment for data exploration, AI/ML modeling, and application development, based on [Jupyter Lab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab).

It enables data scientists and developers to perform a wide range of data science tasks within the Python development environment,
such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, machine learning model training and evaluation, and even deploying models as applications.
