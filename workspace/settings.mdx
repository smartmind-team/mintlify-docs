### API Token

The API Token is a unique security key used to authenticate and authorize API requests.
This token must be included in the authentication header when making API calls, allowing the server to identify the user and verify the request's validity. For privacy and security reasons, the token should be refreshed periodically.

<Warning>
  Be aware that refreshing your API Token will automatically expire your previous tokens.
