The Workspace is a PaaS (Platform as a Service) product that enables data processing, AI/ML modeling, and application development with ThanoSQL. You can leverage the power of SQL and the versatility of Jupyter notebooks to query and analyze your data efficiently.

The workspace is composed of two pages, the **Main Page** and the **Service Page**.

- **Main Page** : Create, view, and manage workspaces.
- **Service Page** : Access various services such as Query Manager and Lab.

## Main Page

You can view and manage workspaces collectively. If you don't have an workspace yet, you can create a new one by clicking the **Start button**. Please refer to the [Create Workspace](#create-a-workspace) guide for instructions.
