The Workspace is a PaaS (Platform as a Service) product that enables data processing, AI/ML modeling, and application development with ThanoSQL. You can leverage the power of SQL and the versatility of Jupyter notebooks to query and analyze your data efficiently.

The workspace is composed of two pages,

- [Main Page](#main-page) : Create, view, and manage workspaces.
- [Service Page](#service-page) : Access various services such as Query Manager and Lab.

## Main Page

You can view and manage workspaces collectively. If you don't have an workspace yet, you can create a new one by clicking the **Start** button. Please refer to the [Create Workspace](#create-workspace) guide for instructions.

Here are the available features on the Service page:

- [Query Manager](./qm): A tool that allows you to execute and track ThanoSQL queries. It provides interfaces such as Query Editor, Query Log, and Data Viewer.

- [Lab](./lab): Provides a versatile environment for data exploration, AI/ML modeling, and application development based on Jupyter Notebook.

- [File Manager](./fm) : This feature allows you to upload and manage files for use in the workspace.

- [Settings](./settings) : You can access general workspace information, usage logs, and data required for development, such as API tokens.

Each service can be accessed by navigating through the left side navigation menu. Also, you can switch between workspaces using the workspace selection menu in the side navigation.
