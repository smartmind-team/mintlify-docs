description: 'Immediately deploy your AI models to your application with SQL'
---

ThanoSQL addresses the universal challenge faced by AI systems, including LLM and other machine learning technologies, in development, deployment, and commercial operations.

Typically, data scientists rely on sample data for training and evaluation, leading to costly and time-consuming re-training iterations.
ThanoSQL solves this by integrating development and operations environments into an analytical RDB, granting access to live, full data.
This enables data scientists to achieve AI accuracy faster, while also empowering IT teams with familiar SQL queries for quicker implementation of business logic,
ultimately enhancing the efficiency of both development and operational workflows without additional costs or time investments.
