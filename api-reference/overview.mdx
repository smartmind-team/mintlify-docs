This document provides a comprehensive reference for our API, allowing developers to seamlessly integrate their applications with our platform. Before proceeding,
it's crucial to replace the `your-engine-url` with the actual `Engine URL` of the Workspace you'll be working with.

<Note>
  You can find `Engine URL` and `API Token` by accessing your Workspaceâ€™s Settings page.
  Head over to the **Developer** tab, and then copy your API Token and Engine URL.
</Note>

## Example

```
curl --request GET \
  --url https://your-engine-url/api/v1/query/log \
  --header 'Authorization: <api-key>'
```
