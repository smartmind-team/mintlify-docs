### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Basic understanding of SQL.
- Access to the [ThanoSQL Console](https://console.thanosql.com/).

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Sign In:** Log in to your ThanoSQL account.
2. **Create a New Workspace:** Navigate to the dashboard and create a new workspace to manage your queries and data. For more information about creating a workspace, check out the [workspace page](workspace/overview).

### Step 2: Uploading Data

There are two ways to upload data into ThanoSQL:

1. **Using File Manager:**
   - Go to the 'File Manager' and upload your datasets. ThanoSQL supports various file formats such as CSV, JSON, and more.
  
2. **Using the Lab:**
   - In the 'Lab' section, upload your data using the table upload functionality:
    ```python
    table = client.table.upload('unsplash_embed', 'unsplash_embed.csv', if_exists='replace')
    table.get_records(limit=10).to_df()
    ```

### Step 3: Writing Your First Query

1. **Basic Query:** Retrieve all records from a specified table.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM your_table_name;
    ```
    On execution, we get:
    ```
    id | column1 | column2
    ---|---------|---------
    1  | value1  | value2
    2  | value3  | value4
    ```

2. **Using AI Models:** Generate AI-driven insights by specifying an AI model and relevant column.
    ```sql
    SELECT thanosql.generate('model_name', 'column_name') FROM your_table_name;
    ```
    Replace `model_name` with the specific AI model you want to use and `column_name` with the relevant column in your dataset.
    On execution, we get:
    ```
    id | generated_output
    ---|-----------------
    1  | output1
    2  | output2
    ```

### Step 4: Utilizing Pre-Built AI Models

<Tip>
To maximize the effectiveness of the pre-built AI models, ensure you familiarize yourself with the ThanoSQL functions before use:

- [Generate](functions/generate)
- [Embed](functions/embed)
- [Predict](functions/predict)

A thorough understanding of these functions will enable you to leverage the full capabilities of ThanoSQL.
</Tip>


1. **Text Generation:** Generate text based on a given prompt.
    ```sql
    SELECT thanosql.generate('model_name', 'Your prompt here') FROM DUAL;
    ```
    On execution, we get:
    ```
    generated_text
    ---------------------------
    Generated text based on prompt
    ```

2. **Embedding Generation:** Create embeddings for a specific column.
    ```sql
    SELECT thanosql.embed('model_name', 'column_name') FROM your_table_name;
    ```
    On execution, we get:
    ```
    TextID | text_embedding
    -------|---------------
    1      | [0.0034567890, -0.008123456, ... , -0.001987654]
    2      | [0.0045678901, -0.010987654, ... , -0.002345678]
    ```

### Step 5: Managing Queries and Results

1. **Save Queries as Template:** Save frequently used queries as template for easy access.
2. **View Results:** Check query results in the Query Manager and use the visualization tools to gain insights from your data.
