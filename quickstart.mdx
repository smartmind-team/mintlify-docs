Welcome to ThanoSQL! This guide will help you get started with the basics of using ThanoSQL to integrate AI functionalities into your SQL queries seamlessly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- A basic understanding of SQL.
- Access to the [ThanoSQL Console](https://console.thanosql.com/).

## Procedures
### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Sign In:** Log in to your ThanoSQL account.
2. **Create a New Workspace:** Navigate to the dashboard and create a new workspace to manage your queries and data. For more information about creating a workspace, check out the [workspace page](/workspace/overview).

### Step 2: Download the Data to Your Local Machine

First, download the dataset, which contains user reviews of a product. By running the following command in your terminal, or by visiting the dataset link [here](https://github.com/smartmind-team/assets/blob/main/datasets/comments_data.csv) and downloading the file manually.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smartmind-team/assets/main/datasets/comments_data.csv
```

The dataset is a CSV file named `comments_data.csv` and contains the following columns:

- **ProductId:** The unique identifier for the product.
- **UserId:** The unique identifier for the user who submitted the review.
- **Text:** The content of the user's review.

Here's a sample of what the dataset looks like:

| ProductId | UserId | Text |
|-----------|--------|------|
| B005K4Q1VI | A1BJHZE41QWBX6 | I received the K-cups on time and in excellent condition. I usually drink coffee, but at night the Hot cocoa is good with a snack, just before bed. |
| B005K4Q1VI | A365A90ZY1Q80T | This is the best hot cocoa I've had in a K-Cup! The taste is smooth and creamy. It's perfect for a cold morning or an evening hot drink. I would definitely recommend this product. The best part is that it can be ordered on auto delivery so I never run out. |


### Step 3: Uploading Data

To upload your dataset to ThanoSQL, follow these steps. ThanoSQL supports various file formats, including `CSV` and `JSON`.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Access Query Manager and Initiate Table Creation">
        Navigate to the `Query Manager` section in the ThanoSQL console and click on the `Create Table` button to start the process.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Choose the File Upload Option">
        Select the `Upload Local File` option. You can also choose `Create New Table Manually` for other use cases, but for this guide, we will use `Upload Local File`.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Set Up Your Table Configuration">
        For this quick guide, leave the default settings as they are. Simply enter the table name: `review_comments_data`.
        ![](/images/quickstart/qm-3.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Upload and Verify Your Data">
        After the upload is complete, navigate to the `Table` tab to verify that your table has been created successfully.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Inspect the Table Schema">
        Click on the table name to view the `Table Schema`, which provides details about the structure of your data.

        </Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Preview the Uploaded Data">
        Click the `Preview` button to inspect the data and ensure everything has been uploaded correctly.

    </Step>
</Steps>


### Step 4: Writing Your First Query

To get started with querying your data in ThanoSQL, go back to Query Manager Editor and let's write a simple SQL query to retrieve all records from your table.

1. **Basic Query:** Retrieve all records from the `review_comments_data` table.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM review_comments_data;
    ```
    On execution, you will see all the records in the table:
    ```
    | ProductId     | UserId        | Text                                                                                                       |
    |---------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | B005K4Q1VI    | A1BJHZE41QWBX6| I received the K-cups on time and in excellent condition. I usually drink coffee, but at night the Hot cocoa is good with a snack, just before bed. |
    | B005K4Q1VI    | A365A90ZY1Q80T| This is the best hot cocoa I've had in a K-Cup! The taste is smooth and creamy. It's perfect for a cold morning or an evening hot drink. I would definitely recommend this product. The best part is that it can be ordered on auto delivery so I never run out. |
    ...
    ```

### Step 5: Utilizing Pre-Built AI Models

<Tip>
ThanoSQL offers powerful pre-built AI models that you can easily integrate into your queries. To make the most of these models, ensure you understand the core ThanoSQL functions:

- [Generate](/functions/generate)
- [Embed](/functions/embed)
- [Predict](/functions/predict)

A solid understanding of these functions will help you fully leverage ThanoSQL's AI capabilities. Familiarize yourself with the ThanoSQL functions mentioned above to maximize the effectiveness of the pre-built AI models.
</Tip>

1. **Sentiment Analysis:** Use a pre-built AI model to predict the sentiment of user reviews.
    ```sql
    SELECT 
        thanosql.predict(
            input := 'Text',
            model := 'bhadresh-savani/distilbert-base-uncased-emotion'
        ) AS predicted_sentiment
    FROM review_comments_data;
    ```

    On execution, you will get the predicted sentiment for each review:
    ```
    | predicted_sentiment                               |
    |---------------------------------------------------|
    | {"label": "anger", "score": 0.47565987706184387}  |
    | {"label": "anger", "score": 0.47565987706184387}  |
    | {"label": "anger", "score": 0.47565987706184387}  |
    | {"label": "anger", "score": 0.47565987706184387}  |
    | {"label": "anger", "score": 0.47565987706184387}  |
    ...
    ```

By following these steps, you can start exploring and analyzing your data using ThanoSQL's integrated AI functionalities.
