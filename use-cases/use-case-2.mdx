description: 'Image Metadata Retrieval with ThanoSQL'
---

## Introduction
Managing and retrieving large image datasets is a common challenge for photographers, art galleries, and companies involved in poster production or exhibitions. This use case will guide you through the process of using ThanoSQL to handle and query large datasets of images and their metadata. By the end of this use case, you will be able to search for images based on both image and text inputs and retrieve detailed metadata about the images, such as dimensions and photographer information.

<Info>
This tutorial can be executed both within ThanoSQL Lab and in a local Python/Jupyter environment. Whether you prefer to work directly within ThanoSQL Lab's integrated environment or set up a local development environment on your machine, the instructions provided will guide you through the necessary steps.

## Goals
1. Obtain photo files and their metadata (e.g., photo dimensions, photographer names).
2. Perform advanced queries on both structured and unstructured data using ThanoSQL to retrieve the desired metadata.

## Procedure
0. **Download Datasets**:
    - First, we will load the datasets into pandas DataFrames and display their shapes to understand the structure and size of the data.
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    unsplash_meta = pd.read_csv("unsplash_meta.csv")
    unsplash_embed = pd.read_csv("unsplash_embed.csv")
    unsplash_embed_sample = pd.read_csv("unsplash_embed_sample.csv")
    unsplash_meta_sample = pd.read_csv("unsplash_meta_sample.csv")   

    print("unsplash_meta:", unsplash_meta.shape, "unsplash_embed:", unsplash_embed.shape)
    print("unsplash_meta_sample:", unsplash_meta_sample.shape, "unsplash_embed_sample:", unsplash_embed_sample.shape)
    ```
    On execution, we get: 
    ![Load Data](/images/use-cases/use-case-2/load-data.png)
    - This step loads the datasets into pandas DataFrames and prints their shapes to give an overview of the data size and structure.

1. **Import ThanoSQL Library**:
    - Next, we need to import the ThanoSQL library and create a client instance. This client will be used to interact with the ThanoSQL engine.
    ```python
    from thanosql import ThanoSQL
    client = ThanoSQL(api_token="your_api_token", engine_url="engine_url")
    ```

2. **Upload Data to Tables**:
    - We upload the `unsplash_embed_sample` table to ThanoSQL. This table contains image paths and their corresponding embeddings.
    ```python
    table = client.table.upload('unsplash_embed_sample', 'unsplash_embed_sample.csv', if_exists='replace')
    table.get_records(limit=10).to_df()
    ```
    On execution, we get: 
    ![Table 1](/images/use-cases/use-case-2/table-1.png)
    - This step uploads the `unsplash_embed_sample` data to ThanoSQL and retrieves the first 10 records to confirm the upload.

    - Similarly, we upload the `unsplash_meta_sample` table which contains detailed metadata about the images.
    ```python 
    table = client.table.upload('unsplash_meta_sample', 'unsplash_meta_sample.csv', if_exists='replace')
    table.get_records(limit=10).to_df()
    ```
    On execution, we get: 
    ![Table 2](/images/use-cases/use-case-2/table-2.png)
    - This step uploads the `unsplash_meta_sample` data to ThanoSQL and retrieves the first 10 records to confirm the upload.

3. **Create Embedding Column**:
    - To store the embedding vectors, we need to create an embedding column in the `unsplash_embed_sample` table.
    ```python
    query_result = client.query.execute(
        """
        CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;

        ALTER TABLE unsplash_embed_sample
        ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS embedding vector(512)
        """
    )
    query_result.state
    ```
    On execution, we get: 
    ![Complete](/images/use-cases/use-case-2/complete.png)
    - This step ensures that the `vector` extension is available and adds an embedding column to the `unsplash_embed_sample` table if it does not already exist.

4. **Embed Images**:
    - Now, we calculate and update the embedding vectors for the images in the `unsplash_embed_sample` table using a pre-trained model.
    ```python
    query_result = client.query.execute(
        """
        WITH calculated_embeddings 
        AS (
        SELECT
            image_path,
            thanosql.embed(
                engine := 'huggingface',
                input := image_path,
                model := 'openai/clip-vit-base-patch32'
            ) AS embedding
        FROM
            unsplash_embed_sample
        )
        UPDATE 
            unsplash_embed_sample
        SET 
            embedding = calculated_embeddings.embedding
        FROM 
            calculated_embeddings
        WHERE
        unsplash_embed_sample.image_path = calculated_embeddings.image_path
        """
    )
    query_result.state
    ```
    On execution, we get: 
    ![Complete](/images/use-cases/use-case-2/complete.png)
    - This step uses the `openai/clip-vit-base-patch32` model to calculate embeddings for each image and updates the `unsplash_embed_sample` table with these embeddings.

5. **Search by Image**:
    - We can perform a similarity search using an example image. Here, we retrieve the embedding vector for an image of a coastal cliff.
    ```python
    query_result = client.query.execute(
        """
        SELECT 
            thanosql.embed(
                engine := 'huggingface',
                input := '/home/jovyan/use_case_2_search/coastal_cliff.jpg',
                model := 'openai/clip-vit-base-patch32'
            ) AS embedding 
        """
    )
    query_result.records.to_df()
    ```
    On execution, we get: 
    ![Result 1](/images/use-cases/use-case-2/result-1.png)
    - This query generates an embedding for the specified image and retrieves it.

    - We then use this embedding to find the most similar images in the `unsplash_embed_sample` table.
    ```python
    query_result = client.query.execute(
        """
        SELECT photo_id, embedding
        FROM unsplash_embed_sample
        ORDER BY embedding <-> (
            SELECT thanosql.embed(
                engine := 'huggingface',
                input := '/home/jovyan/use_case_2_search/coastal_cliff.jpg',
                model := 'openai/clip-vit-base-patch32'
                ) 
                AS embedding
            )
        LIMIT 3
        """
    )
    query_result.records.to_df()
    ```
    On execution, we get: 
    ![Result 2](/images/use-cases/use-case-2/result-2.png)
    - This query retrieves the three most similar images to the example image based on their embeddings.

6. **Query Metadata for Retrieved Images**:
    - Next, we retrieve detailed metadata for the images found in the previous step.
    ```python
    query_result = client.query.execute(
        """
        SELECT photo_id,
               photo_image_url, 
               photo_submitted_at, 
               photo_width, 
               photo_height, 
               photographer_username, 
               photographer_first_name, 
               photographer_last_name, 
               exif_camera_make, 
               exif_camera_model, 
               exif_iso, 
               exif_aperture_value, 
               exif_focal_length, 
               exif_exposure_time
        FROM unsplash_meta_sample
        WHERE photo_id 
        IN (
            SELECT photo_id
            FROM unsplash_embed_sample
            ORDER BY embedding <-> (
            SELECT 
            thanosql.embed(
                engine := 'huggingface',
                input := '/home/jovyan/use_case_2_search/coastal_cliff.jpg',
                model := 'openai/clip-vit-base-patch32'
                )
            )
            LIMIT 2
        )
        """
    )
    df = query_result.records.to_df()
    df
    ```
    On execution, we get: 
    ![Result 3](/images/use-cases/use-case-2/result-3.png)
    - This query retrieves metadata such as the image URL, submission date, dimensions, and photographer information for the images found in the previous step.

7. **Display Retrieved Images**:
    - We can now display the retrieved images using the metadata.
    ```python
    import requests
    from PIL import Image
    from io import BytesIO
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    def show_images(df, image_column_name):
        num_images = len(df)
        fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, num_images, figsize=(15, 5))
        
        if num_images == 1:
            axes = [axes]
        
        for idx, (image_url, ax) in enumerate(zip(df[image_column_name], axes)):
            response = requests.get(image_url)
            response.raise_for_status()
            image = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))
            ax.imshow(image)
            ax.axis('off')

        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.show()

    show_images(df, 'photo_image_url')
    ```
    On execution, we get: 
    ![Image Display 1](/images/use-cases/use-case-2/image-display-1.png)
    - This code fetches and displays the images using their paths from the metadata.

8. **Search by Text**:
    - We can also perform a similarity search using a text description. Here, we search for the image that is most similar to the description "a photo of a coastal cliff".
    ```python
    query_result = client.query.execute(
        """
        SELECT photo_id
        FROM unsplash_embed_sample
        ORDER BY embedding <-> (
        SELECT 
        thanosql.embed(
            engine := 'huggingface',
            input := 'a photo of a coastal cliff',
            model := 'openai/clip-vit-base-patch32'
            )
        )
        LIMIT 1
        """
    )
    query_result.records.to_df()
    ```
    On execution, we get: 
    ![Result 4](/images/use-cases/use-case-2/result-4.png)
    - This query generates an embedding for the text description and retrieves the most similar image based on its embedding.

    - We then retrieve the meta information for the retrieved image.
    ```python
    query_result = client.query.execute(
        """
        SELECT photo_id,
            photo_image_url, 
            photo_submitted_at, 
            photo_width, 
            photo_height, 
            photographer_username, 
            photographer_first_name, 
            photographer_last_name, 
            exif_camera_make, 
            exif_camera_model, 
            exif_iso, 
            exif_aperture_value, 
            exif_focal_length, 
            exif_exposure_time
        FROM unsplash_meta_sample
        WHERE photo_id 
        IN (
            SELECT photo_id
            FROM unsplash_embed_sample
            ORDER BY embedding <-> (
            SELECT 
            thanosql.embed(
                engine := 'huggingface',
                input := 'a photo of a coastal cliff',
                model := 'openai/clip-vit-base-patch32'
                )
            )
        )
        """
    )
    df = query_result.records.to_df()
    df
    ```
    On execution, we get: 
    ![Result 5](/images/use-cases/use-case-2/result-5.png)
    - This query retrieves metadata for the image that matches the text description.

    - Finally, we display the retrieved image.
    ```python
    show_images(df, 'photo_image_url')
    ```
    On execution, we get: 
    ![Image Display 2](/images/use-cases/use-case-2/image-display-2.png)
    - This code fetches and displays the image using its URL from the metadata.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you will be able to efficiently manage and retrieve image metadata from large datasets using ThanoSQL. This capability is invaluable for various applications, including art exhibitions, poster production, and digital asset management. The ability to perform both image-based and text-based searches enables a flexible and powerful approach to handling visual data.
