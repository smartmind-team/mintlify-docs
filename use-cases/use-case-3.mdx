### Introduction
Understanding customer sentiment through product reviews is crucial for businesses aiming to enhance their product offerings and customer satisfaction. This use case will guide you through the process of analyzing product reviews, classifying them into various emotional categories using natural language processing (NLP), and linking these reviews with sales data. By the end of this use case, you will be able to uncover insights about how different emotional categories of reviews correlate with product sales, helping you make data-driven decisions to improve your products and marketing strategies.

### Dataset
We will be working with the following datasets:
- **Review Comments Table (review_comments)**: Contains textual reviews of products.
  - `ProductId`: Unique identifier for each product.
  - `UserId`: Unique identifier for each user.
  - `Text`: Text of the product review.
- **Review Comments Sentiment Table (review_comments_sentiment)**: Contains product reviews along with their sentiment classification.
  - `ProductId`: Unique identifier for each product.
  - `UserId`: Unique identifier for each user.
  - `Text`: Text of the product review.
  - `Sentiment`: Sentiment classification of the review.
- **Sales Data Table (review_sales)**: Contains sales data for each product.
  - `ProductId`: Unique identifier for each product.
  - `Score`: Sales score for the product.

### Goals
1. Classify product reviews into emotional categories.
2. Link classified reviews with corresponding sales data.
3. Generate actionable insights based on the analysis of linked data.

### Procedure
1. **Import ThanoSQL Library**:
    - Import the ThanoSQL library and create a client instance. This client will be used to interact with the ThanoSQL engine.
    ```python
    from thanosql import ThanoSQL
    client = ThanoSQL(api_token="your_api_token", engine_url="engine_url")
    ```

2. **Upload Data to Tables**:
    - Upload the `review_sales` table which contains sales data for each product.
    ```python
    table = client.table.upload("review_sales", "sales_data.csv", if_exists='replace')
    table.get_records(limit=10).to_df()
    ```
    On execution, we get: 
    ![Sales Data Table](/images/use-cases/use-case-3/table-1.png)
    - This step uploads the `review_sales` data to ThanoSQL and retrieves the first 10 records to confirm the upload.

    - Upload the `review_comments` table which contains textual reviews of products.
    ```python
    table = client.table.upload("review_comments", "comments_data.csv", if_exists='replace')
    table.get_records(limit=10).to_df()
    ```
    On execution, we get: 
    ![Review Comments Table](/images/use-cases/use-case-3/table-2.png)
    - This step uploads the `review_comments` data to ThanoSQL and retrieves the first 10 records to confirm the upload.

    - Upload the `review_comments_sentiment` table which contains product reviews along with their sentiment classification.
    ```python
    table = client.table.upload("review_comments_sentiment", "comments_data_sentiment.csv", if_exists='replace')
    table.get_records(limit=10).to_df()
    ```
    On execution, we get: 
    ![Review Comments Sentiment Table](/images/use-cases/use-case-3/table-3.png)
    - This step uploads the `review_comments_sentiment` data to ThanoSQL and retrieves the first 10 records to confirm the upload.

3. **Classify Reviews and Aggregate Sales Data**:
    - Predict sentiment for reviews using a pre-trained model and aggregate the data to link reviews with sales.

    - **Predict Sentiment for Reviews**:
      ```python
      query_result = client.query.execute("""
          SELECT
              "ProductId",
              "Text",
              (jsonb_array_elements_text(
                  (thanosql.predict(
                      input := "Text",
                      model := 'bhadresh-savani/distilbert-base-uncased-emotion',
                      model_args := '{"top_k": 1}',
                      token := 'your_token'
                  )::jsonb)
              )::jsonb ->> 'label') AS "Sentiment"
          FROM
              review_comments
          LIMIT 10;
      """)
      query_result.records.to_df()
      ```
    On execution, we get: 
    ![Predicted Sentiment](/images/use-cases/use-case-3/result-1.png)
      - This query predicts the sentiment of each review using the `distilbert-base-uncased-emotion` model and retrieves the first 10 predictions to confirm the process.

    - **Link Reviews with Sales Data**:
      - Group reviews by `ProductId` and `Sentiment` to show the count of each sentiment and the corresponding sales data for each product.
      ```python
      query_result = client.query.execute("""
          SELECT 
              s."ProductId",
              SUM(s."Score") AS total_quantity_sold,
              r."Sentiment",
              COUNT(r."Sentiment") AS sentiment_count
          FROM 
              review_sales s
          JOIN
              (
                  SELECT
                      "ProductId",
                      "Text",
                      (jsonb_array_elements_text(
                          (thanosql.predict(
                              input := "Text",
                              model := 'bhadresh-savani/distilbert-base-uncased-emotion',
                              model_args := '{"top_k": 1}',
                              token := 'your_token'
                          )::jsonb)
                      )::jsonb ->> 'label') AS "Sentiment"
                  FROM
                      review_comments
                  LIMIT 100
              ) r
          ON 
              s."ProductId" = r."ProductId"
          GROUP BY 
              s."ProductId", r."Sentiment"
          ORDER BY 
              s."ProductId", sentiment_count DESC;
      """)
      query_result.records.to_df()
      ```
    On execution, we get: 
    ![Linked Reviews and Sales Data](/images/use-cases/use-case-3/result-2.png)
      - This query links the reviews with sales data by grouping them by `ProductId` and `Sentiment`. It calculates the total quantity sold and the count of each sentiment for each product.

    - **Analyze Positive Reviews and Sales Performance**:
      - Show the relationship between sales and positive reviews (`joy`, `love`, `surprise`, `neutral`) for each product.
      ```python
      query_result = client.query.execute("""
          WITH positive_reviews AS (
              SELECT 
                  "ProductId",

                              )::jsonb)
                          )::jsonb ->> 'label') AS "Sentiment"
                      FROM
                          review_comments

                  SUM("Score") AS total_quantity_sold
              FROM 
                  review_sales
              GROUP BY 
                  "ProductId"
          )
          SELECT 
              ts."ProductId",
              ts.total_quantity_sold,
              COALESCE(pr.positive_count, 0) AS positive_count,
              CASE 
                  WHEN pr.positive_count IS NULL THEN 'No Positive Reviews'
                  WHEN ts.total_quantity_sold > (
                      SELECT AVG(total_quantity_sold) 
                      FROM total_sales
                  ) THEN 'Above Average Sales'
                  ELSE 'Below Average Sales'
              END AS sales_performance
          FROM 
              total_sales ts
          LEFT JOIN 
              positive_reviews pr
          ON 
              ts."ProductId" = pr."ProductId"
          ORDER BY 
              ts.total_quantity_sold DESC;
      """)
      query_result.records.to_df()
      ```
    On execution, we get: 
    ![Positive Reviews and Sales Performance](/images/use-cases/use-case-3/result-3.png)
      - This query analyzes the relationship between positive reviews and sales performance for each product. It categorizes the sales performance based on the average sales.
