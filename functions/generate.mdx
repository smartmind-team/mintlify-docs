title: 'Generate'
description: 'thanosql.generate()'
---

The `generate` function in ThanoSQL is designed to generate text based on a given input using a pre-trained text generation model. This function leverages the capabilities of the HuggingFace Transformers library to provide efficient and high-quality text generation.

## Syntax 

```sql
SELECT 
    [sequential_column,] [partition_column,] column_name, ...
    thanosql.generate(
        engine := 'engine_name',
        input := [column_name | 'input_text'],
        model := 'model_name',
        model_args := 'model_args_in_json',
        token := 'auth_token',
        base_url := 'base_url' -- Only applicable when the engine is 'openai'
    ) AS generated_text
FROM 
    table_name
```

## Parameters

## Example Usage


<Warning>
The following examples are provided to help you become familiar with the ThanoSQL syntax. To try out these queries in real scenarios, please visit the [Use Cases](/use-cases/overview) section for detailed tutorials and practical applications.
</Warning>

<Tip>
To run the models in this tutorial, you will need the following tokens:
- **OpenAI Token**: Required to access all the OpenAI-related tasks when using OpenAI as an engine. This token enables the use of OpenAI's language models for various natural language processing tasks.
- **Huggingface Token**: Required only to access gated models such as Mistral on the Huggingface platform. Gated models are those that have restricted access due to licensing or usage policies, and a token is necessary to authenticate and use these models. For more information, check this [Huggingface documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/models-gated).
Make sure to have these tokens ready before proceeding with the tutorial to ensure a smooth and uninterrupted workflow.

### Using Hugging Face Generation Models
Here is an example of how to use the `generate` function using Hugging Face LLM:

```sql
SELECT 
    thanosql.generate(
        input := prompt,
        engine := 'huggingface',
        model := 'smartmind/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2',
        token := 'huggingface_token',
        model_args := '{"max_new_tokens": 7}'
    ) AS summary
FROM
    transcript
```
On execution, we get: 
```
| summary                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| This call was in regards to a customer inquiry about the status of their recent order. The customer expressed frustration about delays. |
| The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog near the river bank...                                                                      |
```

<Note>Please note that you would need to create an access token from Hugging Face and usage grant from the gated models like Mistral and Llama in order to use those models.</Note>

## Using the OpenAI Client 
Here is an example of how to use the `generate` function with the base URL using the OpenAI Client:

```sql
SELECT 
    thanosql.generate(
        engine := 'openai',
        input := 'Once upon a time in a faraway land',
        model := 'your_model_name',
        base_url := 'your_base_url', -- Only applicable when the engine is 'openai'
        token := 'your_token'
    ) AS generated_text
```
On execution, we get: 
```
| generated_text                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Once upon a time in a faraway land, there lived a wise old king who...        |
```


### Standalone Usage
Here is an example of how to use the generate function as a standalone query:

```sql
SELECT 
    thanosql.generate(
        engine := 'openai',
        input := 'Once upon a time in a faraway land',
        model := 'gpt-4o',
        model_args := '{"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 50}',
        token := 'openai_api_key'
    ) AS generated_text
```
On execution, we get: 
```
| generated_text                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Once upon a time in a faraway land, there lived a wise old owl who had seen many seasons come and go...  |
```


## Model Restrictions
<Warning>
When using the `generate` function with the `huggingface` engine, ensure that only models compatible with the HuggingFace pipeline are used. Verify that the selected model is supported by the HuggingFace library to avoid compatibility issues. Even with compatible models, some models might still not work. We are actively working on improving compatibility and functionality to provide a better user experience. For more information, refer to the official [Hugging Face documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.41.3/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.TextGenerationPipeline).
</Warning>

## Best Practices
<Tip>
To optimize resource management in a limited environment, especially when loading and using different LLM models, it is advisable to use the `cleanup_resources` function after loading up the LLM model. This helps prevent models from being loaded in CPU memory, which is particularly useful in a workspace with limited resources.
```sql
SELECT * FROM thanosql.cleanup_resources();
```
This function clears all loaded resources, including models, tokenizers, and pipelines, ensuring that resources are properly freed after use.
</Tip>

## Advanced Configuration

The `generate` function allows for advanced configuration through the `model_args` parameter, which accepts additional model arguments in JSON format. This enables fine-tuning of the text generation process to better suit specific needs.

### Common Model Arguments

Here are some common parameters you can use with `model_args`:


| Parameter        | Type    | Description                                                                                           |
|------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `max_tokens`(OpenAI), `max_new_tokens`(Hugging Face) | integer | Maximum number of tokens to generate.                                                                 |
| `temperature`    | float   | Sampling temperature. Lower values make output more focused, higher values make it more random.       |
| `top_p`          | float   | Nucleus sampling probability. Controls diversity by sampling from the top probability mass. Used as alternative to `tempearture`           |


### Example Configurations

1. **Generating Short, Focused Text**

   To generate short and focused text, you might want to use lower values for `max_tokens` and `temperature`:

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       thanosql.generate(
           input := prompt,
           engine := 'openai',
           model := 'gpt-4o',
           token := 'openai_api_key',
           model_args := '{"max_tokens": 10, "temperature": 0.3}'
       ) AS summary
   FROM
       transcript
   ```

2. **Generating Creative Content**

   For more creative and diverse outputs, you can increase the `temperature` or use `top_p` instead:

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       thanosql.generate(
           input := product_details,
           engine := 'openai',
           model := 'gpt-4o',
           token := 'openai_api_key',
           model_args := '{"max_tokens": 50, "temperature": 0.9}'
       ) AS promotional_content
   FROM
       product_catalog
   ```

3. **Controlling Output Length**

   If you need to control the length of the generated text, adjust the `max_tokens/max_new_tokens` parameter accordingly:

   ```sql
   SELECT
       thanosql.generate(
           input := article_intro,
           engine := 'huggingface',
           model := 'smartmind/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2',
           model_args := '{"max_new_tokens": 150, "temperature": 0.7}'
       ) AS expanded_intro
   FROM
       news_articles
   ```
