title: 'Embed'
description: 'thanosql.embed()'
---

The `embed` function in ThanoSQL is designed to generate embeddings for given input data using a pre-trained model. This function utilizes various engines to provide efficient and high-quality embeddings for text, images, and other types of data.

## Syntax 

```sql
SELECT 
    [sequential_column,] [partition_column,] column_name, ...
    thanosql.embed(
        engine := 'engine_name',
        input := [column_name | 'input_text_or_path'],
        model := 'model_name',
        model_args := 'model_args_in_json',
        tokenizer_args := 'tokenizer_args_in_json',
        token := 'auth_token',
        base_url := 'base_url' -- Only applicable when the engine is 'openai'
    ) AS embedding
FROM 
    table_name
```

- **list**: The generated embeddings based on the input.

## Example Usage

<Warning>
The following examples are provided to help you become familiar with the ThanoSQL syntax. To try out these queries in real scenarios, please visit the [Use Cases](/use-cases/overview) section for detailed tutorials and practical applications.
</Warning>

<Tip>
To run the models in this tutorial, you will need the following tokens:
- **OpenAI Token**: Required to access all the OpenAI-related tasks when using OpenAI as an engine. This token enables the use of OpenAI's language models for various natural language processing tasks.
- **Huggingface Token**: Required only to access gated models such as Mistral on the Huggingface platform. Gated models are those that have restricted access due to licensing or usage policies, and a token is necessary to authenticate and use these models. For more information, check this [Huggingface documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/models-gated).
Make sure to have these tokens ready before proceeding with the tutorial to ensure a smooth and uninterrupted workflow.

### Using Hugging Face Embedding Models (Text)
Here is an example of how to use the `embed` function using a Hugging Face model:

```sql
SELECT 
    thanosql.embed(
        input := text_column,
        engine := 'huggingface',
        model := 'openai/clip-vit-base-patch32',
        model_args := '{"device_map": "cpu"}'
    ) AS text_embedding
FROM
    documents
```
On execution, we get: 
```
| text_embedding                                   |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| [0.0034567890, -0.008123456, ... , -0.001987654] |
| [0.0045678901, -0.010987654, ... , -0.002345678] |
```

<Note>Please note that you would need to create an access token from Hugging Face to use certain models.</Note>

### Using Hugging Face Embedding Models (Image)
Here is an example of how to use the `embed` function to generate embeddings for an image using Hugging Face model:
```sql
SELECT embedding
FROM unsplash_embed_sample
ORDER BY embedding <-> (
    SELECT thanosql.embed(
        engine := 'huggingface',
        input := '/home/jovyan/use_case_search/coastal_cliff.jpg',
        model := 'openai/clip-vit-base-patch32',
        model_args := '{"device_map": "cpu"}'
        ) 
        AS embedding
)
```
On execution, we get: 
```
| embedding                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------|
| [-0.08091072, -0.07656342, -0.046813846, 0.344484, ...] |
| [-0.0023032427, 0.14910948, -0.12709272, 0.072619, ...] |
| [0.18557435, 0.17372614, 0.08067615, 0.28555152, ...]   |

```

<Warning>As of right now, only CLIP models are supported for image embedding with the Hugging Face engine.</Warning>

### Using OpenAI Embedding Models
Here is an example of how to use the `embed` function using an OpenAI model:

```sql
SELECT
    thanosql.embed(
        input := text_column,
        engine := 'openai',
        model := 'text-embedding-ada-002',
        token := 'openai_api_key'
    ) AS text_embedding
FROM
    documents
```
On execution, we get: 
```
| text_embedding                                    |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| [0.0023064255, -0.009327292, ... , -0.0028842222] |
| [0.0034567890, -0.012345678, ... , -0.0012345678] |
```

<Note>Please note that you would need to create an API key from OpenAI.</Note>

### Standalone Usage
Here is an example of how to use the `embed` function as a standalone query:
```sql
SELECT 
    thanosql.embed(
        engine := 'huggingface',
        input := 'Once upon a time in a faraway land',
        model := 'openai/clip-vit-base-patch32',
        model_args := '{"device_map": "cpu"}'
    ) AS text_embedding
```
On execution, we get: 
```
| text_embedding                         |
|----------------------------------------|
| [0.012345, -0.023456, ... , -0.034567] |
```

## Using the OpenAI Client 
Here is an example of how to use the `embed` function with the base URL using the OpenAI Client:

```sql
SELECT 
    thanosql.embed(
        engine := 'openai',
        input := 'Once upon a time in a faraway land',
        model := 'your_model_name',
        base_url := 'your_base_url', -- Only applicable when the engine is 'openai'
        token := 'your_token' -- Optional, depending on the base_url requirements
    ) AS text_embedding
```
On execution, we get: 
```
| text_embedding                         |
|----------------------------------------|
| [0.014321, -0.021234, ... , -0.042567] |
```

## Model Restrictions
<Warning>
When using the `embed` function with the `huggingface` engine, ensure that only models compatible with the HuggingFace AutoModel and AutoTokenizer are used. Verify that the selected model is supported by the HuggingFace library to avoid compatibility issues. Even with compatible models, some models might still not work. We are actively working on improving compatibility and functionality to provide a better user experience. For more information, refer to the official [Hugging Face documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/auto).
