The `predict` function in ThanoSQL is designed to perform various prediction tasks using pre-trained models. This function supports a range of tasks, leveraging the capabilities of different engines.

## Syntax 

```sql
SELECT 
    [sequential_column,] [partition_column,] column_name, ...
    thanosql.predict(
        task := 'task_name',
        engine := 'engine_name',
        input := [column_name | 'input_data'],
        model := 'model_name',
        model_args := 'model_args_in_json',
        pipeline_args := 'pipeline_args_in_json',

## Example Usage

<Note>
  When using text-generating models with the `huggingface` engine, the default `truncation_policy` is 'strict'. This could result in an error if the token count exceeds the model's limit. If this happens, reduce the text length or use `pipeline_args = "{'truncation_policy': True}"`.
</Note>

<Warning>
The following examples are provided to help you become familiar with the ThanoSQL syntax. To try out these queries in real scenarios, please visit the [Use Cases](/use-cases/overview) section for detailed tutorials and practical applications.
</Warning>

<Tip>
To run the models in this tutorial, you will need the following tokens:
- **OpenAI Token**: Required to access all the OpenAI-related tasks when using OpenAI as an engine. This token enables the use of OpenAI's language models for various natural language processing tasks.
- **Huggingface Token**: Required only to access gated models such as Mistral on the Huggingface platform. Gated models are those that have restricted access due to licensing or usage policies, and a token is necessary to authenticate and use these models. For more information, check this [Huggingface documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/models-gated).
Make sure to have these tokens ready before proceeding with the tutorial to ensure a smooth and uninterrupted workflow.

### Text Classification
Here is an example of how to use the `predict` function for text classification using a Hugging Face model:

```sql
SELECT
    thanosql.predict(
        task := 'text-classification',
        engine := 'huggingface',
        input := text_column,
        model := 'google-bert/bert-base-uncased',
        model_args := '{"device_map": "cpu"}'
    ) AS prediction
FROM
    documents
```
On execution, we get: 
```
| prediction                            |
|---------------------------------------|
| {'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.998} |

## Model Restrictions
<Warning>
  When using the `predict` function with the `huggingface` engine, ensure that only models compatible with the HuggingFace pipeline are used. Verify that the selected model is supported by the HuggingFace library to avoid compatibility issues. Even with compatible tasks and pipeline models, some models might still not work. We are actively working on improving compatibility and functionality to provide a better user experience. For more information, refer to the official [Hugging Face documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines).
